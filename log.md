**Today's Progress: Finishing CSS3 Basics. Learned about Positioning (static, relative, absolute and fixed), Floating elements and Hiperlinks Styles. Developed the design of a Blog.

**Thoughts: Positioning was quite easy. I struggled a little bit with all the divs and paddings and margins, but I am enjoying the progress.


###Day 1: 29th April, 2020

**Today's Progress: I finished the Blog and started learning about CSS selectors, specificity and inheritance. I learned how to make a vertical navigation menu.

###Day 2: 30th April, 2020

**Today's Progress: I've learned how to make a horizontal navigation menu, how to mark up the current page, how to make a navigation with tabs, layout with fixed width and liquid layout, liquid images, false column and how to stylize a table.

**Thoughts: Very interesting and quite easy so far.

###Day 3: 1st May, 2020

**Today's Progress: I've started to build a News Website, just HTML and CSS not functional yet, fixed layout. Updated my instagram and forgot this one lol Follow me there! instagram.com/bruna_452

**Thoughts: Very challenging to format the whole website without checking how the teacher is doing it. Actually I couldn't do it, I had to follow a lot of teacher's instructions to build the website.

###Day 4: 2nd May, 2020

**Today's Progress: Finished the website. It has 3 columns page, 2 columns and 1 column. 

**Thoughts: Quite challenging to deal with all the divs

3rd and 4th May DID NOT CODE :(

###Day 5: 5th May, 2020

**Today's Progress: I've started to build a Bed & Breakfast Website with fluid layout. Not responsive yet, just fluid with min and max width. Very challenging and again, need the teacher's help many times.

**Thoughts: I'm enjoying this so much! Can't stop doing it. My family complains I stay in my bedroom for too long but I just can't stop doing what I'm doing hahahahaha

6th May DID NOT CODE :(

###Day 6: 7th May, 2020

**Today's Progress: I've finished Bed & Breakfast Website with fluid layout.

**Thoughts: This second part was quite easier than first half, but I still needed some help from teacher, couldn't do it 100% alone.

###Day 7: 8th May, 2020

**Today's Progress: Learned about parallax effect, box sizing, rounded corners, gradient and transparencies, new HTML5 tags, shadows, animations and transitions with CSS.

**Thoughts: This was very cool. I knew CSS was powerful but to the point of making animations? That was surprising!

###Day 8: 9th May, 2020

**Today's Progress: Learned about Flexbox.

**Thoughts: Almost didn't code today. Spent a lot of time with family.

###Day 9: 10th May, 2020

**Today's Progress: Started to build a website for a fake Museum using HTML5 and CSS.

**Thoughts: Very cool project!

###Day 10: 11th May, 2020

**Today's Progress: Stopped museum project to build a website for family business!

**Thoughts: Even more cool project!

###Day 11: 12th May, 2020

**Today's Progress: Finished museum project!

**Thoughts: Very nice and learned a few tricks.

### HOLY CRAP MORE THAN A MONTH WITHOUT CODING! =/ LET'S START OVER! ###

###Day 1: 28th June, 2020

**Today's Progress: Finished uncle's Jack website! 

**Thoughts: Very disappointed at me for stopping coding for such a long time but a little proud that at least I'm back on track and heady to kick some asses. I learned the basics about Bootstrap and it's features, how to use flexbox and organize sections and menus. Pretty cool!

###Day 2: 29th June, 2020

**Today's Progress: Finished Spotify-Copy homepage!

**Thoughts: Learned about carousel. Quite easy. I think the hard part it's the idea, obviously. To design the website, the concept. After you already have it, coding it is easy. Of course I'm talking about simple websites.

###Day 3: 30th June, 2020

**Today's Progress: Published uncle's Jack website with .com.br domain name and created accounts at Free Code Camp and Code Pen websites. 

**Thoughts: I tried to start building a webpage for my sister and for my surprise I wasn't able to do very simple stuff by heart. I got really disappointed at myself and decided to go deeper on HTML and CSS until I master it! These two tools are enough to make very beautiful websites so I need to be good at it before moving foward to Javascript.
Uncle's Jack business website is published and working well in all devices :)
Just remembered I should get some SEO lessons too.

###Day 4: 1st July, 2020

**Today's Progress: Started Free Code Camp Responsive Web Design Certification and finished 3 first modules. 

**Thoughts: It's been very cool using the free code camp website! Their system is very neat and intuitive, the quality and objectiveness of the lessons are very high, really liked it. As there's no video and just challenges, I can do it at my own pace.

###Day 5: 2nd July, 2020

**Today's Progress: Doing the forth module of Free Code Camp Responsive Web Design Certification.

**Thoughts: So far it is easy as I already know the content, I'm just fixing it in my mind. Maybe I will feel like this the entire certification process, lets see. Still dont know how to make the image fulfil the entire screen no matter the size of the screen.

###Day 6: 3rd July, 2020

**Today's Progress: Finished fourth and fifth part of the course and learned a few things about accessibility and responsive features.

**Thoughts: Finally learned the thing that made me start this: how to make an image responsive! ðŸ˜œ
Now I know all I had to do was to set the image properties to max-width: 100% and height: auto ðŸ™ƒ sooo freaking simple! I will never forget again hahahaha

###Day 7: 4th July, 2020

**Today's Progress: Finished sixth and seventh part of the course and now I will move on to the eighth and last part of it: building projects!

**Thoughts: It seems like I know how to do stuff, but I still doesn't know the best way to do it. The fastest, easiest. I feel like it will take many time to do something that I experienced programmer would do within minutes. So that's the secret I guess: experience. I need to practice more and more, build many projects, even if it is for fake business or people, just build it! The experience will make me faster and more confident.

###Day 8: 5th July, 2020

**Today's Progress: Built Project 1 of 5. 

**Thoughts: Still hard to do things from memory. For this project I checked a few times the source-code of the example given to see how it was done.

###Day 9: 6th July, 2020

**Today's Progress: Built Project 2 of 5. 

**Thoughts: I could not make my page to look exactly like the example. Text fields are still bigger than the div limits and I'm still checking source-code.

###Day 10: 7th July, 2020

**Today's Progress: Built Project 3 of 5. 

**Thoughts: Before starting this project I've studied a little about Flexbox and Grid and also checked a few websites source-code. I'm starting to think that there's more than one way to build a webpage and all the ways are correct as long as the code is clean and following the good practices. Or maybe not, there is one right way and many wrong ways lol Anyway, I've studied about flexbox and grid too, the difference between them and when to use each one. Got a better understanding on how flexbox works, it feels like I was doing things ramdomly, without actually knowing what I was doing and just followig the teacher or the example. Now I think I've started to understand the process of adjusting a layout with flexbox and grid. But just starting, as I still don't know how to make just one card per row when wraping. Look at the difference between the example and my work when you shrink the page width. In the example, the card shrinks to a minimum width and then goes one card per row. I couldn't do that =/

###Day 11: 8th July, 2020

**Today's Progress: Started a 3-Day course on SEO. Also the day of the Aunt and the Nice was stablished! =)

**Thoughts: Quite boring. Don't like this "digital marketing" subject but it's an important knowledge, at least the basics, so let's go for that.

###Day 12: 9th July, 2020

**Today's Progress: Learned how to use tools like Keywordtool.io and Ubersuggest. 

**Thoughts: Still boring, but easy. Learned the importance of understanding the high volume and low volume keywords and when to target each one, head tail, short tail and medium tail keywords, user intention, meta description tags, robots.txt, the importance of sitemap and snipets on SERP. User intention, snipets and SERP has a lot to do with my current job at Lionbridge so very easy to understand this part.

###Day 13: 10th July, 2020

**Today's Progress: Finished the SEO course. Learned about Google Web Dev Tools.

**Thoughts: Interesting! Web Dev is definetely something I'll take a look all the time. Page Speed Insights tool seems to be really useful to test the speed of the webpage and the reasons for the result, something I was thinking about some other day. Also learned how to use the https protocol. (I'll try to migrate my uncle's webpage later.)

###Day 14: 11th July, 2020

**Today's Progress: Saw some videos and articles about SEO. Relaxing day, no coding, no studying. Tomorrow will be 14/100 again.

###Day 14: 12th July, 2020

**Today's Progress: Finished building Project 4 of 5.

**Thoughts: Easier than the other projects. Built it completely by myself but when I finished and checked example source code to compare I found out I made it completely different at first, using flexbox while example used absolute, fixed and relative positions with margins.

###Day 15: 13th July, 2020

**Today's Progress: Built Project 5 of 5 and officially FINISHED RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN CERTIFICATION!

**Thoughts: Quite hard to set up the projects grid! I'm still struggling with flexbox and grid, I will dive deeper on it and study more and practice more as I think I should master these two things before moving on.

###Day 16: 14th July, 2020

**Today's Progress: Watched videos and tutorials about Flexbox and Grid and also started building my portfolio.

**Thoughts: I'm still struggling with Grids and position: absolute/relative. Sometimes I see the teacher doing stuff that has no logic for me but at the end it works so I'm gonna keep practicing and studying this.

###Day 17: 15th July, 2020

**Today's Progress: Finished building my portfolio!

**Thoughts: I'm starting to get Flexbox and Grid a little better. Watched many videos on youtube and I'm starting to feel more confortable to build layouts. I didn't launch my website yet as I still need to finish some projects to put in there. But the sctructure is ready.

###Day 18: 18th July, 2020

**Today's Progress: Started with Javascript! Learned about variables, operators and data treatment. I'm very excited! It seems scary when I think about all the things this language can do and how complex it will be to do all that. But in parallel I'm also watching this [algorithm course](https://www.cursoemvideo.com/course/curso-de-algoritmo/) which is helping me a lot to understand the logic. Also, still working on creating my sister's webpage and improving my uncle's page.

**Thoughts: Yes, I spent two days not coding. But I watched videos related to programming, read a little bit on the HTML & CSS book... it was not completely wasted days but yes, no excuses, two days not coding just because it was cold and I felt like just being lazy and enjoying the weather lazyness not doing any s%&$ at all. Damn...

###Day 19: 19th July, 2020

**Today's Progress: Learned about DOM manipulation.

**Thoughts: I think things seemed hard at first cause I was skipping steps. Now I found this course with this amazing teacher who makes everything step by step and this way I can keep up with the lessons. Let's say it's a Javascript for dummies hahahaha it fit me well :)
