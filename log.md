100 Days Of Code - Log

###Day 0: 28 April, 2020

**Today's Progress: Finishing CSS3 Basics. Learned about Positioning (static, relative, absolute and fixed), Floating elements and Hiperlinks Styles. Developed the design of a Blog.

**Thoughts: Positioning was quite easy. I struggled a little bit with all the divs and paddings and margins, but I am enjoying the progress.


###Day 1: 29 April, 2020

**Today's Progress: I finished the Blog and started learning about CSS selectors, specificity and inheritance. I learned how to make a vertical navigation menu.

**Thoughts: So far so good. I felt like practicing so I started coding an old project again from Curso em Video "Projeto Glass".

**Today's Progress: I've learned how to make a horizontal navigation menu, how to mark up the current page, how to make a navigation with tabs, layout with fixed width and liquid layout, liquid images, false column and how to stylize a table.

**Thoughts: Very interesting and quite easy so far.
