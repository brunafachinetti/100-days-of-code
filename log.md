100 Days Of Code - Log

###Day 0: 28th April, 2020

**Today's Progress: Finishing CSS3 Basics. Learned about Positioning (static, relative, absolute and fixed), Floating elements and Hiperlinks Styles. Developed the design of a Blog.

**Thoughts: Positioning was quite easy. I struggled a little bit with all the divs and paddings and margins, but I am enjoying the progress.


###Day 1: 29th April, 2020

**Today's Progress: I finished the Blog and started learning about CSS selectors, specificity and inheritance. I learned how to make a vertical navigation menu.

**Thoughts: So far so good. I felt like practicing so I started coding an old project again from Curso em Video "Projeto Glass".

###Day 2: 30th April, 2020

**Today's Progress: I've learned how to make a horizontal navigation menu, how to mark up the current page, how to make a navigation with tabs, layout with fixed width and liquid layout, liquid images, false column and how to stylize a table.

**Thoughts: Very interesting and quite easy so far.

###Day 3: 1st May, 2020

**Today's Progress: I've started to build a News Website, just HTML and CSS not functional yet, fixed layout. Updated my instagram and forgot this one lol Follow me there! instagram.com/bruna_452

**Thoughts: Very challenging to format the whole website without checking how the teacher is doing it. Actually I couldn't do it, I had to follow a lot of teacher's instructions to build the website.

###Day 4: 2nd May, 2020

**Today's Progress: Finished the website. It has 3 columns page, 2 columns and 1 column. 

**Thoughts: Quite challenging to deal with all the divs

### 3rd and 4th May DID NOT CODE :( ###

###Day 5: 5th May, 2020

**Today's Progress: I've started to build a Bed & Breakfast Website with fluid layout. Not responsive yet, just fluid with min and max width. Very challenging and again, need the teacher's help many times.

**Thoughts: I'm enjoying this so much! Can't stop doing it. My family complains I stay in my bedroom for too long but I just can't stop doing what I'm doing hahahahaha

### 6th May DID NOT CODE :( ###

###Day 6: 7th May, 2020

**Today's Progress: I've finished Bed & Breakfast Website with fluid layout.

**Thoughts: This second part was quite easier than first half, but I still needed some help from teacher, couldn't do it 100% alone.

###Day 7: 8th May, 2020

**Today's Progress: Learned about parallax effect, box sizing, rounded corners, gradient and transparencies, new HTML5 tags, shadows, animations and transitions with CSS.

**Thoughts: This was very cool. I knew CSS was powerful but to the point of making animations? That was surprising!

###Day 8: 9th May, 2020

**Today's Progress: Learned about Flexbox.

**Thoughts: Almost didn't code today. Spent a lot of time with family.

###Day 9: 10th May, 2020

**Today's Progress: Started to build a website for a fake Museum using HTML5 and CSS.

**Thoughts: Very cool project!

###Day 10: 11th May, 2020

**Today's Progress: Stopped museum project to build a website for family business!

###Day 11: 12th May, 2020

**Today's Progress: Finished museum project!

**Thoughts: Very nice and learned a few tricks.

### HOLY CRAP MORE THAN A MONTH WITHOUT CODING! =/ LET'S START OVER! ###

###Day 1: 28th June, 2020

**Today's Progress: Finished uncle's Jack website! 

**Thoughts: Very disappointed at me for stopping coding for such a long time but a little proud that at least I'm back on track and heady to kick some asses. I learned the basics about Bootstrap and it's features, how to use flexbox and organize sections and menus. Pretty cool!

###Day 2: 29th June, 2020

**Today's Progress: Finished Spotify-Copy homepage!

**Thoughts: Learned about carousel. Quite easy. I think the hard part it's the idea, obviously. To design the website, the concept. After you already have it, coding it is easy. Of course I'm talking about simple websites.

###Day 3: 30th June, 2020

**Today's Progress: Published uncle's Jack website and created accounts at Free Code Camp and Code Pen. 

**Thoughts: I tried to start building a webpage for my sister and for my surprise I wasn't able to do very simple stuff by heart. I got really disappointed at myself and decided to go deeper on HTML and CSS until I master it! These two tools are enough to make very beautiful websites so I need to be good at it before moving foward to Javascript.
Uncle's Jack business website is published and working well in all devices :)
Just remembered I should get some SEO lessons too.

###Day 4: 1st July, 2020

**Today's Progress: Started Free Code Camp Responsive Web Design Certification and finished 3 first modules. 

**Thoughts: It's been very cool using the free code camp website! Their system is very neat and intuitive, the quality and objectiveness of the lessons are very high, really liked it. As there's no video and just challenges, I can do it at my own pace.

###Day 5: 2nd July, 2020

**Today's Progress: Doing the forth module of Free Code Camp Responsive Web Design Certification.

**Thoughts: So far it is easy as I already know the content, I'm just fixing it in my mind. Maybe I will feel like this the entire certification process, lets see. Still dont know how to make the image fulfil the entire screen no matter the size of the screen.

###Day 6: 3rd July, 2020

**Today's Progress: Finished fourth and fifth part of the course and learned a few things about accessibility and responsive features.

**Thoughts: Finally learned the thing that made me start this: how to make an image responsive! ðŸ˜œ
Now I know all I had to do was to set the image properties to max-width: 100% and height: auto ðŸ™ƒ sooo freaking simple! I will never forget again hahahaha

###Day 7: 4th July, 2020

**Today's Progress: Finished sixth and seventh part of the course and now I will move on to the eighth and last part of it: building projects!

**Thoughts: It seems like I know how to do stuff, but I still doesn't know the best way to do it. The fastest, easiest. I feel like it will take many time to do something that I experienced programmer would do within minutes. So that's the secret I guess: experience. I need to practice more and more, build many projects, even if it is for fake business or people, just build it! The experience will make me faster and more confident.

###Day 8: 5th July, 2020

**Today's Progress: Built Project 1 of 5. 

**Thoughts: Still hard to do things from memory. For this project I checked a few times the source-code of the example given to see how it was done.

###Day 9: 6th July, 2020

**Today's Progress: Built Project 2 of 5. 

**Thoughts: I could not make my page to look exactly like the example. Text fields are still bigger than the div limits and I'm still checking source-code.

###Day 10: 7th July, 2020

**Today's Progress: Built Project 3 of 5. 

**Thoughts: For this project I checked many, many times the source-code. I'm pretty sure that are more than one way to build webpages and both or all of them are correct as long as the code is as much small and clean as possible.
