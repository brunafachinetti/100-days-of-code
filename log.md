100 Days Of Code - Log

###Day 0: 28th April, 2020

**Today's Progress: Finishing CSS3 Basics. Learned about Positioning (static, relative, absolute and fixed), Floating elements and Hiperlinks Styles. Developed the design of a Blog.

**Thoughts: Positioning was quite easy. I struggled a little bit with all the divs and paddings and margins, but I am enjoying the progress.


###Day 1: 29th April, 2020

**Today's Progress: I finished the Blog and started learning about CSS selectors, specificity and inheritance. I learned how to make a vertical navigation menu.

**Thoughts: So far so good. I felt like practicing so I started coding an old project again from Curso em Video "Projeto Glass".

###Day 2: 30th April, 2020

**Today's Progress: I've learned how to make a horizontal navigation menu, how to mark up the current page, how to make a navigation with tabs, layout with fixed width and liquid layout, liquid images, false column and how to stylize a table.

**Thoughts: Very interesting and quite easy so far.

###Day 3: 1st May, 2020

**Today's Progress: I've started to build a News Website, just HTML and CSS not functional yet, fixed layout. Updated my instagram and forgot this one lol Follow me there! instagram.com/bruna_452

**Thoughts: Very challenging to format the whole website without checking how the teacher is doing it. Actually I couldn't do it, I had to follow a lot of teacher's instructions to build the website.

###Day 4: 2nd May, 2020

**Today's Progress: Finished the website. It has 3 columns page, 2 columns and 1 column. 

**Thoughts: Quite challenging to deal with all the divs

### 3rd and 4th May DID NOT CODE :( ###

###Day 5: 5th May, 2020

**Today's Progress: I've started to build a Bed & Breakfast Website with fluid layout. Not responsive yet, just fluid with min and max width. Very challenging and again, need the teacher's help many times.

**Thoughts: I'm enjoying this so much! Can't stop doing it. My family complains I stay in my bedroom for too long but I just can't stop doing what I'm doing hahahahaha

### 6th May DID NOT CODE :( ###

###Day 6: 7th May, 2020

**Today's Progress: I've finished Bed & Breakfast Website with fluid layout.

**Thoughts: This second part was quite easier than first half, but I still needed some help from teacher, couldn't do it 100% alone.

###Day 7: 8th May, 2020

**Today's Progress: Learned about parallax effect, box sizing, rounded corners, gradient and transparencies, new HTML5 tags, shadows, animations and transitions with CSS.

**Thoughts: This was very cool. I knew CSS was powerful but to the point of making animations? That was surprising!

###Day 8: 9th May, 2020

**Thoughts: Almost didn't code today. Spent a lot of time with family.

###Day 9: 10th May, 2020
